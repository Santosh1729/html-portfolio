<hr />


<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This is a fantastic movie with all the elements for great entertainment. The emotional story of Jack and Rose along the
backdrop of a monstrous tragedy is heart wrenching. It is a movie which you cannot watch only once. You have to watch it
again.</p>

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>A movie with pioneering technology and a great story of Navi race belonging to another planet fighting against 
the humans for their survival as the humans want to inhabit their land by destroying them. A superb action movie with a great
storyline.</p>

<h3>Unbroken</h3>
<p>The story of olympic star Louie Zamperini from a wild kid to an olympic runner and setting a record in olympics 
for the fastest last lap in 5000 metres running. Not only that but surving a plane crash and getting stranded on a
raft with two fellow soldiers for 45 days and in this situation while fighting hunger and for their life, getting attacked
by enemy plane and sharks and still managing to survive. Then getting caught by the Japanese army and being held as a prisoner of war
for almost 6 years till the end of World War II. This is a movie to watch if you are looking for inspiration and meaning
of life to understand what a human being can bear and achieve.</p>
